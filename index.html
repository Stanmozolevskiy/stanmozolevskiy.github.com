                        <p class="firstLetter "> My name is Stanislav Mozolevskiy, I was born in USSR and I would like to share couple thoughts with you. Sometimes my live goes in such a way that everything is mixed up together: love, hate, ups and downs, success and failure.I
                            think one is impossible without the other, and it seems that every person once stumbled and realized the wrong part of their actions and learned important lessons for themselves.
                        </p>
                        <p> In point of fact, learning is an interesting and fascinating process that allows us to learn the experience that has accumulated humanity for centuries and millennia.We study mathematical rules and physical laws, over the discovery
                            of which great scientists worked all their life, spending years in laboratories and libraries.
                        </p>

                        <p> Learning new things is crucial in our society and we need to move forward and do not stand still, to learn and understand new technologies.The live is so much more interesting when you are comprehensive, develop and improve yourself!
                            You can become attached to progress and you feel how the world changes in our modern times.
